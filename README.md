# NoNamePeople Homepage - Initial

You are a Frontend Developer and have been tasked to build the page in the mockup. Please read the instructions and build the page you see in the Mockup (reference image at the bottom of this README) accordingly as close to the example as possible. Changing the color of the logo image is an optional bonus!

## Instructions

1. Using the Mockup(Image) as a reference, build the site as represented in the mockup.
2. Using The [Golden Ratio Calculator](https://grtcalculator.com/), calculate the GRT for your Typography.
 - `Header` should use the `logo.svg` or `logo.png` from the assets folder.
 - `Hero` section of your page should contain a `button` and the `hero.svg` from the assets folder side by side.
3. `Our Services` section should contain an `unordered list` with services.
4. Use font awesome icons for the `footer` section.
5. The illustrations in the mockup can be found in the assets folder in both SVG and PNG formats.

## Design Information

| Element | color   |
| ------- | ------- |
| h1      | #000F37 |
| h2      | #000F37 |
| p       | #4F4F4F |

- Font-family = [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=Open+Sans&selection.family=Open+Sans&sidebar.open=true)

## BONUS

* If you open the logo.svg image you might notice that SVG is actually a text based format! To change the color of the image add `fill="#68e1fd"` into the root `<svg>` element just like you would add an HTML attribute, like `id="123"`.
